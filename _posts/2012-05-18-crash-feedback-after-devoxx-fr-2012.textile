My CRaSH quickie had a good attendance at Devoxx and it was great to see many folks interested in the project.

<a href="http://linsolas.free.fr/wordpress/index.php/2012/04/devoxx-france-dernier-jour/">Romain</a> and <a href="http://www.duminy.fr/blog/?p=1655">Fabien</a> blogged about CRaSH and the feedback is good (although short but it was at 15mn quickie after all :-) ). The blog are written in french language though.

The 1.0 release was done also during Devoxx and now the project's follower on GitHub has increased to more than <a href="https://github.com/vietj/crash/watchers">60 persons</a>.

Devoxx FR 2012 was a great moment and a fantastic opportunity to evangelize CRaSH. We are now actively working on the forth coming CRaSH 1.1, stay tuned and follow the project!
