  @SeanJa

  Nice write up. One thing that should be useful to check out, especially for JavaScript developers new to AIR is the:
  
  Adobe AIR for JavaScript Developers Pocketguide
  http://www.tostring.org/books/adobe-air-for-javascript-developers-pocketguide/1.0/en/
  
  It provides a good introduction to getting started with AIR, and also provides a mini cookbook for doing common tasks (including some examples using the embedded database).

content: Hey Julien - I think AIR uses webkit as the browser? So could you use AIR to build "single application web app" type app? (something your users could optionally download to ensure they get the optimal experience if its a really complex ajax app).

  @duff : hard to know as the memory footprint is global
  @zack : with twhirl what is the idle CPU time used ?

  AIR itself isn't slim, for sure. Instantiating a webkit instance makes it even bigger, though, but that's not surprising: browser engines are not lightweight. What is particularly problematic is that there seem to be memory leaks within the webkit engine as used in AIR, and there is no way to profile memory usage. Apps like Spaz run into this problem because it's constantly pulling in large amounts of new data, loading new images, and the like.
  
  Also note that the CPU usage while idling is particularly a problem with OS X. On Windows, AIR seems to not have this problem.
  
  I don't think using 20MB or more is horrible, considering the technology. AIR is a full Flash runtime, and HTML apps add a webkit renderer on top of that. The memory and CPU usage is in line -- or a bit lower -- than most SSBs. Using traditional browser tech to build a desktop app is going to be a tradeoff in terms of memory and CPU usage, no doubt.

content: "@Finkler: I agree with you that 20megs is not the fundamental problem. For me the most problematic issue is the CPU consumed. Spaz itself consumes around 10% of my CPU even if it does not seem active (i.e just waiting the next refresh). About the leak, indeed the memory consumed seems to increase and Adobe does not provide the tools or the hooks (\xC3\xA0 la Java VM instrumentation) to properly know what happens."
