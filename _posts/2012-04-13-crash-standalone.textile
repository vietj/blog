I'm very glad to announce the availability of standalone version of CRaSH. CRaSH standalone is an alternative way to use CRaSH, designed to be usable out of the box from the command line.

And there is more! A few months ago when I was looking at the jvisualvm source code I found the attach API. The attach API allows to plug an agent in an existing and running JVM (that's what jvisualvm uses natively) and I thought it would be a great feature for CRaSH. I quickly got a prototype running but it took a while to make it usable out of the box.

The standalone version comes with the <a href="http://vietj.github.com/crash/">1.0.0-cr2</a> we just released, for this matter I have recorded a screencast to show how easy and powerful CRaSH standalone can be:
