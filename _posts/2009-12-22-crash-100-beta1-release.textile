I'm glad to announce the release of <a href="http://crsh.googlecode.com/files/crsh-1.0.0-beta1.zip">CRaSH 1.0.0-beta1</a>!!!

But wait, what is CRaSH?

CRaSH is a shell for Java Content Repository that allows remote connection to a server and performs various operations such as browsing and interacting with the repository, executing queries, performing import/export operations. You can read a complete introduction <a href="http://code.google.com/p/crsh/wiki/Introduction">here</a>.

As a GateIn developer I often use the underlying JCR engine and I developed CRaSH as a companion for my development tasks.

The project is written in Java and Groovy and leverages a few good open source projects:
<ul>
	<li>The command system is written in Groovy allowing seamless extension of the shell by adding new commands</li>
	<li>Netty provides the remote connection capabilities</li>
	<li>Args4j parses the command line and inject the option and argument in the Groovy commands</li>
</ul>
It comes as a war file that setup a telnet daemon on the port 5000.

The project is developed on <a href="http://crsh.googlecode.com">Google Code</a> under the LGPL license and contributions are welcome :-) !</div>
