After a bit more than two years of development CRaSH is about to reach the 1.0 status, the candidate release 1 was just released with a few achievements:
<ul>
	<li>The CRaSHÂ <a href="http://vietj.github.com/crash/">website</a> was launched a few days ago to give a better face to the project</li>
	<li>Many improvements were done to finish the work (standalone & attach mode, jackrabbit support, etc...)</li>
</ul>
<div>Last but not least I will give a <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/FR12/CRaSH+un+shell+pour+etendre+la+plateforme+Java">quickie</a> at Devoxx France on CRaSH to show what CRaSH is able to do and what it can do for you.</div>
