The main CRaSH team, i.e [Alain Defrance](http://www.alain-defrance.com) and myself will be present at Devoxx 2012 for from Monday to Thursday evening.

On Monday 12th we will present a [Tools in Action  session](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/CRaSH+an+extensible+command+line+for+the+JVM). The Tools in Action format is a perfect fit for showing how you can use CRaSH in your daily work. It does not require any particular knowledge except being familliar with Java :-) .

During the session we will show you three use cases that CRaSH can solve:

 * CRaSH the developer's swiss knife
 * Create custom dashboards for aggregating statistics and metrics of the JVM
 * Add a Command Line Interface to your project
 * How to write a shell command

During the talk you will learn how to use CRaSH, the new features of the upcoming 1.2 release and *more*, here is a teaser video!

On Tuesday 13th we will be present at the [Devoxx Hackergarten](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Hackergarten+Hands-On+Coding+Event). The Hackergarten a great opportunity for being involved in CRaSH development, there are many ways for being a contributor, we have some ideas, but the best is that you come with your own :-)
