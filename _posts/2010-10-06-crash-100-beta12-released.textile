We just release the <a href="http://crsh.googlecode.com/files/crsh-1.0.0-beta12.tar.gz">1.0.0-beta12</a> of CRaSH that add two new commands:

<ol>
	<li>The addnode command adds one or several JCR nodes</li>
	<li>The setperm command provides security configuration of JCR nodes</li>
</ol>

The rm command has also be improved and provides the capability to remove several nodes at the same time.
